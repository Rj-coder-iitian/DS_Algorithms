Bubble sort and Insertion sort –
Average and worst case time complexity: n^2
Best case time complexity: n when array is already sorted.
Worst case: when the array is reverse sorted.
Selection sort –
Best, average and worst case time complexity: n^2 which is independent of distribution of data.
Merge sort –
Best, average and worst case time complexity: nlogn which is independent of distribution of data.
